Visual Rhythmic Detector: Liveness Detection Through PPG

## Abstract
A biometric authentication system can recognise a human, but it may not have the ability to know if it is interacting with one. Thus, this paper presents a solution to detect an individual's presence in a video without relying on human supervision. The method introduces a multistage approach of temporal filtering on the input and extracts the signal's narrow bandwidth, which resembles the frequency of a human heartbeat. A broad and narrow range filtering sequence preserves vital information required for classification. Examining the pixel intensity and frequency with the standard threshold of human heartbeat reveals the outcome. The method goes one step further by comparing the prominence of the highest peaks to eliminate noise. No specialised equipment and computational resources are required for this solution, making it easy to be implemented, even within an existing infrastructure.
Furthermore, this method can be administered on any exposed human skin and is not limited to a predetermined region of interest. Lastly, it removes the dependency of the active involvement of the subject, such as facial voluntary or involuntary movements. Thus, the solution has the potential to be used in a wide range of applications that requires liveness detection.
